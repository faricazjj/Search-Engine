# Search-Engine
This project simulates a search engine using a binary search tree data structure. It is written in Java by Farica Zhuang
using Eclipse. The "Input.txt" file is a sample input file format where the single words are the key words and the 
words in the lines right below that are words related to the key word. Hence, when we search for the key word in this
search engine, the related words will be printed to the console. When a string of two words is searched, let's say "Sunny
California", words that are related to both "Sunny" and "California", or the intersecting words, will be printed. Moreover,
it will print words related to "Sunny" but not "California", and words related to "California" but not "Sunny".
